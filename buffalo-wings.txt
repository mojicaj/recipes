Ingredients:
 - 1 pound of chicken wings

 - 1/2 cup butter
 - 6 cloves of garlic
 - 1/2 cup Apple Cider Vinegar
 - 1 tablespoon Cayenne pepper
 - 1/2 teaspoon Paprika
 - 1 teaspoon salt

Directions:
 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Pour the olive oil over the wings and mix them until all wings are covered.  Season with the salt and bake them in the oven 1 hour.

 2. In a large pot, melt the butter on medium heat. Mince the garlic and cook it in the butter for 2-3 minutes until light brown.

 3. Pour the hot sauce and apple cider vinegar into the pot.  Then mix in the cayenne pepper and paprika and bring to a boil.

 4. After the wings have been baked an hour pour some of the buffalo sauce over them and mix well so all the wings are covered.  Then bake for another hour.

 5. Once the wings are done cooking mix them with the rest of the buffalo sauce and serve.
